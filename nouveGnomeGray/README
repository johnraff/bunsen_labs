Installation:
=============
(1) Put this folder in '~/.icons/', i.e. in the hidden folder ".icons" in your home directory (create it if it doesn't exist);

(2) In GNOME3, you could update the icon cache with the following command in Terminal, replacing <USER_NAME> with your user name:

	gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 /home/<USER_NAME>/.icons/nouveGnomeGray

(3) In GNOME3, choose the theme from Advanced Settings > Theme > Icon Theme.

This is true for Debian-based systems, at least.

Distros:
========
By default, the theme uses the GNOME foot logo as the distro logo. To make the theme use the logo of your distro (in start menu, for example), find "YOUR_DISTRO-logo.png" in the 16x16 to 48x48 "places" folders and link these images to it:

	distributor-logo.png
	start-here.png
	gnome-main-menu.png

For example, open a terminal in the 16x16 "places" folder and do:

	ln -s -f YOUR_DISTRO-logo.png distributor-logo.png
